# Simpsons-GIFs
This site gives the user quick, easy access to all the most popular Simpsons GIFs at GIPHY.com. The user can select from one of the characters already listed or add a new one.

## Features
  * When a character button is clicked, the ten most popular GIFs will display.
  * The user can add as many characters as desired.
  * Each time a new character is clicked, the previous images are removed in order to keep the display from looking cluttered.
  * When viewed on a large screen, the top two GIFs appear in a larger format, followed by the remaining eight images in an easy to see view.
  * When viewed on a tablet or phone, the GIF takes up the full width of the screen for easy viewing.
  * When viewed on a smaller screen, the ability to add a character moves to the top of the screen for easier access.
  * The user can click on any image to animate it; clicking again stops it.
  * When the user enters a new character, any non-alphanumeric characters will be removed and spaces will be replaced with & for better search results. For example, searching for "simpsons&Mr&Burns" yields better results than "simpsons&MrBurns".
  * Ratings are shown below each GIF.
